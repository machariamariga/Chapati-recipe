<h2>Now that you know what you need here is the process of it all</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the warm water and the flour into a consistent dough that is not sticky and also not too dry</li>
        <li>After the dough is ready, cut it out to smaller rollable pieces into sort of small flat pieces</li>
        <li>once that is done, it is time for the rolling which in my opinion is the most fun part</li>
        <li>After rolling have your pan hot and ready to get cooking</li>
        <li>First dry the rolled chapati without oil first but as soon as it starts showing brown speck, whip out the oil and add a little oil frying each side until a consistent brown colour appears</li>
    </ol>

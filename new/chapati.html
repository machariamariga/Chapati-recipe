    <h1>CHAPATI</h1>
</head>
<body>
<h4>
    For anyone out there who may not know what exactly chapati is, welcome to East Africa. As an East African native, Kenyan to be specific, I do not want to hog the spotlight so I will put it in writing for the record that chapati indeed do origin from the Indian subcontinent.<b></b> By defintion, chapati or chappati, depending on where you are from is basically unleavened breadborn of the rather quite simple blend of wheat flour mixed into dough with water and salt and sugar to taste. Behold the delicacy that is chapatti!!!!
